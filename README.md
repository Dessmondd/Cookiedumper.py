The main reason behind this project was a desire to enhance Python skills and fulfill work requirements for class, or even maybe someone using this tool or finding it useful.
Python's flexibility makes it the ideal choice for create automation tools like this one!

As a small project this really helped me with,Scraping, browser automation and data extraction. These skills are highly valued not only in Data Analysis but also Cybersecurity!
